# Hi,
My background and core competences are security engineering and DevOps, but I love the whole process of building products. Though I rarely write code, I enjoy writing code. 
<p>
With few years of experience in security engineering and DevOps, I'm looking forward to bring DevSecOps into action as much as possible.

I love to share my understanding and knowledge and always greatful whenever I get corrected. :)
